# Tom's FFmpeg Time-lapse Scripts

This collection of scripts produce and edit time-lapses of a windows desktop without having the hassle of images in the tens of thousands. **Directly from your desktop to a video file.**

For any of these scripts to work you must have FFmpeg installed and added to the path variable.

## target-time.bat

Changes the speed of the video to have a set duration.
